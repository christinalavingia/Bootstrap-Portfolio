                        <p>My name is Christina Lavingia. I have a background in content production and am working to broaden my skillset to encompass programming. My goal is to be able to write, wireframe and code webpages from start to finish.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not working (or studying) I love to read, win at Fantasy Football, eat tacos, watch sunsets and wine taste. Basically many of the staples of living in Santa Barbara, California.</p>
                        <p>Despite being brand new to web dev, one of my most proud career accomplishments has to do with launching a new website for my current employer.</p>
                        <p>We went from one static page that briefly touched on some of our features, to a dozen pages each diving in detail to better sell our product.</p>
                        <p>We're looking forward to the SEO benefits of having more pages, as well as further lead gen opportunities with additional CTAs — now on every page.</p>
                        <p>I hope that this program through UCLA helps me pursue a richer career path in marketing and brand management. It's a unique path to be taking, but so far I'm loving making pages just like these.</p></div>
